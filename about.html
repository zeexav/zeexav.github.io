                            An experienced Business/Data Analyst with a keen eye for detail and a proven history in optimizing workflow processes and leveraging data to help organizations meet their goals seeking to apply those skills to the field of Data Engineering. Having worked with both the technical and business side of organizations, I have the advantage of understanding the business big picture which will inform the building of an accurate and efficient data solution. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At each of my previous positions, I quickly learned how the organization operated and what the challenges were in meeting specific goals. Using that knowledge along with my skills in SQL, database design, Advanced Excel, HTML5 and CSS, I was able to develop solutions that increased the company's bottom line or satisfied a reporting requirement. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have augmented my knowledge by successfully completing the Professional Certificate in Data Analytics at Columbia Engineering. This course allowed me to hone my skills in Python (including numpy and pandas packages), develop ETL pipelines, and become knowledgeable in Javascript and Machine Learning.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With my experience and newly minted skills, I am looking to contribute my creative problem solving and attention to detail to a data-driven team where I can continue to grow and become a valued team member.
